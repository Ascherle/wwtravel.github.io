	<h2>Veronika Turner</h2>
    <p>I was born to a Russian mother and an American father in Lugovaya, Moscow Region Russia. Shortly after, we moved to Norway for three years, and then moved to the US and settled in Bozeman Montana, where I have grown up. I consider myself very lucky to have grown up in a bilingual and multicultural household. <br/> Back home in the US I study graphic design, and enjoy drawing and reading as a hobby. Like every Montanan I also love skiing and hiking in our beautiful Rocky Mountains. My favorite spot to hang out in Bozeman is Townshend‚Äôs Tea House, there is no better spot to get some homework done or relax with your friends in a cozy and friendly atmosphere! <br/> I studied German for some time in school and college, and came to Weingarten, Germany to study media design for a more relaxed year before I continue my program back home. I had always been fascinated by German history and culture and have already seen so many beautiful places, I can‚Äôt wait to do some more traveling in the upcoming semester and to continue meeting new people.</p>

  	<h2>Angela Scherle</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in southern Germany. I grew up in a religious town close to Munich, but thanks to my grandparents, who owned a farm, I also got insight in the rural life as a kid, something that always intrigued me. I'm generally no fan of big cities, although I do enjoy visiting them sometimes.<br>
        Ever since I can remember I have been a fan of animals of all kind, and whenever I'm on holidays in a foreign country, I like to search for indigenous species, may it only be little lizards or bugs.<br>
        Currently I'm studying Digital Media Design in Weingarten, Germany, something that has interested me since I was a little kid. Besides design-related work I like listening to music, hiking in the woods, or horse-riding. I also like traveling, even though the student life doesn't allow you to journey too much. Germany is a beautiful country, but I've never come around much and there is yet so many places I want to see, so many countries I want to visit.</p>
