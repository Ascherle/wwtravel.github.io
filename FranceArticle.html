        <h3>1/11/18 <br> Arrival in Strasbourg </h3>

        In the early morning I took a bus to the Stuttgart Airport where my friend Ayberk and I got a rental car. He managed to find a really awesome deal and I got to feel fancy for the next few days with an open hatch Fiat. Back in Montana it
        would be far too cold at this point in the year, but central Europe has a milder climate, I've noticed. From Stuttgart, Strasbourg was a mere 2 hours away by car on the autobahn. After several months using only public transport, I had
        forgotten how much faster you can get around by car; although the very well developed transport system is something I really appreciate about living in Europe. <br><br>
        <div class="grid2 imagecontainerright">
          <img class="articleimage" src="ImageFolder/Gallery/France/3France.jpg" alt="City Center">
          <div>
            <p>Strasbourg City Center</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        Once we arrived, we checked into our hotel, which was in a small town right outside of Strasbourg. It was sort of the cheapest option we found so it definitely wasn't glamorous, but I've stayed in tents in the mountains for months at a time
        so it was perfectly fine for me.
        The first thing we did was take the tram to the city and walk around the city center. The main cathedral, Notre Dame de Strasbourg, is very tall and features a gorgeous rose window on its west facade. For an art history geek, this is a
        highly recommended place to see! We had dinner at a cozy pub, where I got the most amazing potato cheese gratin and red wine that I have ever tried. The French know how to make food!

        <h3>2/11/18 <br> Culture & Nightlife </h3>

        The next day we did a lot of walking around the city. We were determined to find the nicest cafes, so we sat at three different places to people watch. We had coffee at each spot, and it was confirmed that the French also know how to make
        good coffee. We walked through the market area and I got a huge crepe filled cheese, (again, so much cheese). The lady making them poured a ladle of crepe batter on a flat hot disk and spread it around, creating a proper circular form and
        waiting for it to become slightly crispy. <br><br>
        <div class="grid2 imagecontainerright">
          <img class="articleimage" src="ImageFolder/Gallery/France/6.6France.jpg" alt="Image">
          <div>
            <p>Crushed Vintage TV Sets</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        Next we went to the modern art museum, which has works by abstract, impressionist, and expressionist artists, and many current artists as well. I especially enjoyed seeing art by Kandinsky, Picasso, and Monet. Not every day that you can see
        all three at once! The modern art was interesting too, lots of themes of everyday items transformed into something thought provoking and weird. For example, a row of old TV sets, some showing random video clips, and the last four with
        crushed glass. I can't always come up with what the artist must have been thinking, but I like to see such bizarre things and speculate. Another thing that caught my attention was a car covered in toy guns with stuffed children's toys all
        over the seats. Maybe the artist was commenting on lost innocence? Loss of control? Who knows! <br><br>

        </div>
        We walked to L'Alchemist Bar and had cocktails in a dark and somewhat gothic atmosphere. The drinks themselves had very odd flavours and were served with glow sticks. I think I got something somewhat reasonable, melon flavored vodka,
        although it was definitely too sweet.
        We didn't catch the 1 am tram so we spent the rest of our time in another bar drinking wine, eating pizza, and people watching until 3 am, then walking around the city until the tram arrived at 4. Getting up to drive back to Stuttgart the
        next morning was not so fun!
