        <p>Russia, a country that stretches over a vast expanse of eastern Europe and northern Asia. Once the preeminent republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.; commonly known as the Soviet Union), Russia became an independent
          country after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991.<p>
            <p>The inhabitants of Russia are quite diverse. Most are ethnic Russians, but there also are more than 120 other ethnic groups present, speaking many languages and following disparate religious and cultural traditions. Most of the
              Russian population is concentrated in the European portion of the country, especially in the fertile region surrounding Moscow, the capital. Moscow and St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) are the two most important cultural and
              financial centres in Russia and are among the most picturesque cities in the world. Russians are also populous in Asia, however; beginning in the 17th century, and particularly pronounced throughout much of the 20th century, a steady
              flow of ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking people moved eastward into Siberia, where cities such as Vladivostok and Irkutsk now flourish.</p>

        <h3>20/12/18 <br> Arrival in Moscow</h3>

        I left Weingarten on December 20th to visit family in Russia for the Holidays. Of course my FlixBus arrived in Ravensburg 40 minutes late so I got to Munich far later than anticipated, but I suppose you should always be prepared for delays
        when traveling. Once I arrived at the main bus station in Munich I took a 40 minute long train ride to get to the airport, so I sat back and watched the urban sprawl go by. <br> Unfortunately though, the delays did not end with the bus
        because Aeroflot had overbooked the flight by over five people so we stood around waiting for attendants to kick people off the plane. For a while it seemed like I‚Äôd be spending my night in the airport (not the first time it would happen),
        but I managed to get a spot near a nice enough couple. Too bad though that I didn‚Äôt land a spot by the window! <br />

          </div>
        </div>
        When I arrived in Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow we were driven from one end of the airport to the other, that airport is like a city on its own! My aunt and uncle met me and we took a taxi back to Dmitrov, their home about an hour‚Äôs drive
        from Moscow. Like your average Russian, they live in an apartment from the soviet era. Apartments are small but cozy and comfortable, the kitchen being the heart of the home. After some potato piroshkis (a Russian traditional pastry), I went
        off to rest for the coming morning.

        <h3>21/12/18 <br> Jazz Concert</h3>

        As my aunt, Tanya, took time off of work to spend time with me, we went to Moscow by train the next morning. We had made plans earlier to go to the New Year‚Äôs jazz concert in the Kremlin Concert Hall. To be honest, jazz is not my favorite
        genre of music, but my aunt adores it. I think it was bearable, disregarding the part where they played music from The Nutcracker in jazz style. That was a sin. <br>

            <p>The Jazz Concert</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        The concert hall is huge, with many different floors and rooms. The walls of each floor were decorated with New Year‚Äôs themed imagery. Among them being bears by evergreen trees covered in snow, and many of our traditional folklore
        characters. Unfortunately though, this was the last day I felt alright before I became very sick with infected tonsils and would spend most of the next days in bed.

            <p>Traditional shuba, "herring fish under a fur coat"</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        On New Year's Eve I was still quite sick but tried to pull myself together to happily greet 2019. On TV my uncle and I watched old soviet movies that show every year. A classic is –∏—Ä–æ–Ω–∏—è —Å—É–¥—å–±—ã, The Irony of Fate. It is a New Year‚Äôs romantic
        comedy about serendipity and how mistakes can lead us to amazing and crazy things. My aunt made —à—É–±–∞ (pronounced shuba), a traditional and festive multi-layered salad type dish. The bottom layer is pickled herring, and the top is shredded
        boiled beet with mayonnaise. The name comes from the word for fur coat in Russian, and is because of the many layers the fish lies under. As if it is wearing a warm coat. We also had bread with caviar, and champagne. Many Russians will
        gather with a far larger feast, but we were just the three of us this year and I was too sick to eat a lot anyway. <br /> I decided to go out despite the cold air to watch the New Year‚Äôs solute and enjoyed the beautiful fireworks. There were
        lights and decorations everywhere in the city square and I wish I could have stayed out longer. My illness was still persisting despite our best efforts and antibiotics.

        <h3>4/1/19 <br> The Red Square </h3>

        My aunt and I decided to go out to Moscow again before I would leave Russia so I wouldn‚Äôt go without having done anything exciting. First we went to the Tretyakov Gallery, which we had to wait in line two hours for, to see the paintings of
        Ivan Kuindzhi. I was inspired by his serene depictions of water and naturescapes. In Moonlit Night on Dnieper, the moon casts a soft green-white glow on the river below.

        In Evening in Ukraine, the sunset gives a warm hue to the white walls of the huts on the side of the hill. When I look at it, I can feel as if I am there. <br />

        <br>
        Next, we went through the metro a bit and looked at the historic art and architecture of the older stations. We walked through the Old Arbat street where I got some Russian sweets for my friends back in Weingarten. This is a very good place
        to have a bite to eat at a restaurant or to check out some souvenirs.
        Then we walked around the Red Square and looked at the beautiful lights and decorations that had been set up for New Year‚Äôs. St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral, not far from the main clock tower, was beautiful as always. I had never seen it cloaked in
        snow as I always visit Russia in the summer. There were so many people ice skating on the rink, buying sweets at the booths, and enjoying time with friends and family. I wish I could have seen more of Moscow this time but we had to head to
        the metro and go home.<br>

        <h3>5/8/16 <br> Walking around Moscow </h3>

        On this trip my brother and I were together in Russia for the first time since I was very little! Because Russia has a military draft system for men under 27, he was finally able to come back to Russia in 2016. We took advantage of our time
        well and filled every day with new adventure. <br>
        <div class="grid2 imagecontainerright">

          </div>
        </div>
        Moscow is huge, and the roads are very wide to let many lanes of traffic speed by. It takes so long to get from one place to another without using the metro but we also wanted to just explore the streets on foot and people watch for a while.
        In the photo my brother and I are standing on a bridge overlooking the Moskva River, with the statue of Peter the Great‚Äôs ship visible in the background. We had street food for lunch, hot piroshky, and then went to the Pushkin Museum, the
        largest museum of European art in Moscow. <br>
        <div class="grid2 imagecontainerleft">

        </div>
        Although he has no relation to the museum, it was renamed the Pushkin Museum after our beloved writer and poet Alexander Pushkin, 100 years after his death. During our visit, the museum had a modern photography exhibition with various photos
        of Russian life and scenery. One that particularly caught my eye was a very Russian themed photo of a cat on a table next to blini (Russian crepes), vodka, and caviar. The caption says ‚Äúwho doesn't work, eats‚Äù, which is a joke on the common
        Russian phrase "who doesn't work, doesn't get to eat", because we feed house cats no matter how lazy they are!

        <h3>7/8/16 <br> At the Dacha </h3>

        Dacha in Russian is a word we use for a summer home, where we grow vegetables and relax away from city life. Our family dacha was built by my Grandfather who unfortunately died right before I was born. Because it has been in the family for
        over 40 years, one can sense it is a place full of memories. Sadly the building itself was never fully completed so the interior has always looked a bit unfinished. Over the years, so many things were stored away, especially because of
        Soviet era poverty. Not knowing what will be available the next week created a mindset for my Grandma and Grandpa to hold on to everything. Because of this, my Brother and I had to help my Aunt and Uncle clean out the shed and various rooms
        on the dacha. <br>
        <div class="grid2 imagecontainerright">

        </div>
        So many old books and papers had to be burned because Russia doesn't have a good recycling system yet. It wasn‚Äôt all about work though, I got to walk around the area and enjoy the summer sun. Although it is a place we will never forget and
        will love forever, we were happy to get it cleaned out to be sold. We have a new plot of land granted by my Aunt's work, which is ready for new beginnings. I made sure to get plenty of photos because I knew I'd probably never see it again.<br>

      <article id="15/08/16">
        <h3><br>15/8/16 <br> Karelia </h3>

        Karelia is a subarctic region far up north divided between Finland and Russia. My Aunt, Brother, and I took a long bus excursion from Dmitrov, where we live, all the way to the Finnish border to see this beautiful region. We saw a beautiful
        Orthodox monastery on Valaam Island, located on Lake Ladoga. The monastery is believed to have been founded at some point toward the end of the 14th century. <br>
        <div class="grid2 imagecontainerright">
          <img class="articleimage" src="ImageFolder/Gallery/Russia/RussiaAug2016/valaam.jpg" alt="Valaam Monastery">
          <div>
            <p>Valaam Monastery</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        The church itself is a beautiful bright white structure with light blue-green onion domes and accents of gold. All about the territory were friendly cats who are fed by the nuns and priests. We got to hear the priests sing Byzantine chants
        and watch a student of iconography at work. <br>
        <div class="grid2 imagecontainerleft">
          <img class="articleimage" src="ImageFolder/Gallery/Russia/RussiaAug2016/Karelia.jpg" alt="Crossing the White Sea">

            <p>Crossing the White Sea</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        We then took a boat across the White Sea to the Solovetsky Islands where we saw the old Solovki Prison Camp. Many of the Bolshevik opponents were sent to this gulag because of its remote location. Before becoming a work camp during the
        soviet era, it was also a monastery, and has since resumed this status. The sea was very stormy on our way back and my coat soaked through, but it was certainly worth it to see the beautiful nature and architecture of this region.<br>
